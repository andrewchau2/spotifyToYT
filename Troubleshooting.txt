Error in running the program?
Songs are only valid in UTF-8 Encoding. If program crashes halfway through reading a song(you can see progress in
"songs.txt"), it means that the song it is trying to read is invalid for that encoding. You must delete it.

If that still doesn't fix the crash, try to run the program again later. Youtube might be experiencing some
lag which will cause failed requests.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Program was running but suddenly crashes saying that quota exceeded?

YT has a certain quota limit to limit the amount of actions a day. However, you can bypass this by changing the
testing.json to yt_secret.json or vise versa in the insertSong.py and searchVid.py

This allows the quota to be redirected to a different project and thus resetting the limit. However, if you exceed both
of these project's quotas, then wait till the next day when it resets

Error in path/wanting to redirect the file path?

File paths are designed to create/update at the current directory, and it is recommended to leave the path as it is.
If you really need to redirect where the file saves at, you need to replace readFileName and writeFileName in BOTH
insertSong.py and searchVid.py with the PRECISE PATH. This may also result in changing the File I/O code

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to change the writing/reading to file name?

It's best to leave this as default, but if you want to:
In insertSong.py,getSongs.py, and searchVid.py, you can replace songs.txt && songsConvert.txt to a different name.
